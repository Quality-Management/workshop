### Messages

### Contacts

![contacts](img/headerContacts.png)

A contact represents the link to a final user that interacted or will interact with the platform, but more than that it's capable of persisting user's data to future uses and sorting.

  - Why a contact exist? <!-- Data storage, filters, rules. -->
  - How is it created? <!-- Dynamic or manual ways and its limits. -->
  - What's important to keep in mind? <!-- Anonymity and privacy policy, data update and erase, real-time actions, types. -->

  - Channels Type <!-- Voice or text, native or external. -->

### Introduction to flows (actionsets/rulesets)

![flows1](img/headerFlows.png)

Flow is the logical condition's tree visual representation that applies to active contacts. When the contact is in a flow, the interaction is direct with each action created one step at a time. The steps are composed of Actions, Rules and determine the flow length.
The complexity of a flow is directly connected to its goal and the ability to explore the platform's features.

  - Editing
  - Testing

### Flow results and exports

When contacts interact with a flow, their answers will be stored as flow's result.

  - Runs
  - Analyzing
  - Exporting

### Triggers

![triggers](img/headerTriggers.png)

Triggers allow the user to start flows based on user actions or schedules. There are different types of triggers and some of them just will be available when a compatible channel is added to the workspace.
The most common is a keyword. It works when a word is set to be the first message's word or the only one.

  - Editing
  - Types
